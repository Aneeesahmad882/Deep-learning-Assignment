    "The purpose of forward propagation in a neural network is to compute the output of the network given a set of input data. During forward propagation, the input data is passed through the network layer by layer, with each layer applying certain transformations (usually in the form of weighted sums followed by activation functions) to generate the output. This process allows the network to make predictions or classifications based on the input data. Essentially, forward propagation is the process of \"feeding forward\" the input data through the network to produce an output."

    "In a single-layer feedforward neural network, also known as a perceptron, forward propagation is relatively straightforward. Here's how it's implemented mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Let's say you have \\( n \\) input features represented as \\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \\). These inputs are fed directly into the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weights and Bias**: Each input feature is associated with a weight, denoted as \\( w_1, w_2, ..., w_n \\). Additionally, there's a bias term, denoted as \\( b \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Sum**: For each neuron (or node) in the single layer, you calculate the weighted sum of the inputs and bias. Let's denote this weighted sum as \\( z \\):\n",
    "   \\[ z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b \\]\n",

    "4. **Activation Function**: This weighted sum \\( z \\) is then passed through an activation function, denoted as \\( \\sigma \\), which introduces non-linearity to the network. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), or the hyperbolic tangent function.\n",

    "5. **Output**: The output of the neuron, after passing through the activation function, is denoted as \\( a \\):\n",
    "   \\[ a = \\sigma(z) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Propagation**: This output \\( a \\) may serve as the output of the network, or it may be further propagated to subsequent layers in a multi-layer network.\n",

    "Activation functions are used during forward propagation to introduce non-linearity into the output of each neuron in a neural network. They essentially determine whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the input weighted sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how activation functions are typically used during forward propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weighted Sum Calculation**: In forward propagation, the inputs to each neuron are multiplied by their respective weights, and the resulting products are summed together. Additionally, a bias term may be added to this sum. This step results in a weighted sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activation Function Application**: After calculating the weighted sum, an activation function is applied to it. This function takes the weighted sum as its input and produces the output of the neuron. The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Generation**: The output of the activation function becomes the output of the neuron and is passed to the neurons in the next layer as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different activation functions have different properties and are suitable for different types of problems. Some common activation functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sigmoid**: \\( \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \\)\n",
    "- **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: \\( \\text{tanh}(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}} \\)\n",
    "- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: \\( \\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z) \\)\n",
    "- **Leaky ReLU**: \\( \\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \\max(\\alpha z, z) \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a small constant (e.g., 0.01)\n",

    "In forward propagation, weights and biases play crucial roles in determining the output of each neuron in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weights**: Weights represent the strength of the connections between neurons in consecutive layers of the network. Each connection between a neuron in one layer and a neuron in the next layer is associated with a weight. During forward propagation, the input data is multiplied element-wise by these weights, and the products are summed to produce the weighted sum for each neuron. These weights are learned during the training process and determine how much influence the input features have on the neuron's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Biases**: Biases are additional parameters added to each neuron that allow the network to represent non-zero intercepts or thresholds. They provide the model with flexibility to better fit the data by shifting the activation function. During forward propagation, biases are added to the weighted sum before the activation function is applied. Like weights, biases are also learned during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, weights and biases determine the behavior and output of each neuron in the network. By adjusting these parameters during training, the network learns to make better predictions or classifications based on the input data. The process of adjusting weights and biases to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs is known as optimization or training."

    "The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for classification tasks. Its primary purpose during forward propagation is to convert the raw output scores (often referred to as logits) into a probability distribution over multiple classes. Here's why softmax is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Interpretation**: The softmax function normalizes the raw output scores into probabilities, ensuring that they sum up to 1. This allows the network to express its confidence in each class prediction. Each output value represents the probability that the input belongs to the corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Class Classification**: In many classification tasks, especially those with multiple classes (more than two), softmax is particularly useful. It provides a way to model the likelihood of each class given the input data, making it suitable for multi-class classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Differentiability**: The softmax function is differentiable, making it compatible with gradient-based optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) during the training process. This allows the network to learn the optimal parameters (weights and biases) by iteratively adjusting them based on the difference between predicted and actual class probabilities."

    "The purpose of backward propagation, also known as backpropagation, in a neural network is to update the model's parameters (weights and biases) based on the computed gradients of the loss function with respect to those parameters. Backpropagation is a key component of the training process in neural networks, allowing them to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Here's why backward propagation is essential:\n",

By computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters, we can determine the direction and magnitude of the parameter updates that will decrease the loss. This iterative process of updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient allows the network to converge towards a minimum of the loss function, leading to better performance.\n",

This allows us to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases of each layer. These gradients are then used to update the model parameters, nudging them in the direction that reduces the loss.\n",

    "3. **Learning Representations**: Backpropagation enables the network to learn meaningful representations of the input data at each layer. By adjusting the weights based on the gradients, the network learns to extract relevant features from the input data that are useful for making predictions or classifications.\n",
